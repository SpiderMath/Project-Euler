# Problem
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

# Concept
Fibonacci Series -> Number Sequence
Works by adding 2 numbers

a<sub>1</sub> = 0  
a<sub>2</sub> = 1  
a<sub>3</sub> = a<sub>1</sub> + a<sub>2</sub>  
a<sub>4</sub> = a<sub>3</sub> + a<sub>2</sub>  
...  
a<sub>n</sub> = a<sub>n-1</sub> + a<sub>n-2</sub>  

For generation,
- We are given an upperlimit which is 4,000,000
- a<sub>1</sub> = 0, a<sub>2</sub> = 1, sum = 0 -> while(sum < upperlimit) -> genFibon()
- genFibon() -> sum = a + b -> b gets value of sum & a gets value of b

So basically we are clear on how to generate fibonacci numbers. **But** we need the sum of EVEN Fibon Nums

# Process
- Generate the fibonacci number -> a, b & sum has to be kept INTACT
- So we introduce another variable, say `evenSum` -> used to record the sum of EVEN Numbers
- So for every fibon generated, we check if odd or even. If yes, then just `evenSum += sum`
- To check if number is odd or even, we use `number % 2 === 0`

Modulo is a function, which returns the remainder when we divide a by b (`a/b`)  

For Example:  
4 mod 2 = 0, becase we get 0 as remainder when we divide 4 by 2  


if(4 % 2 === 0) then our even code  

`if(x [some odd number] % 2 === 0) then code won't be executed`  
Reason: odd % 2 = 1
